Components of Kafka:
---------------------
1.Producer
2.Consumer
3.Broker(Kafka Server)
4.Topic : specifies the category of message.Listeners can then just respond to messages
          that belong to topics they are listening on.
5.Partition: give better performance and high Availability.
  - storage challenges solved: Topic get partitioned.
  - help with Down-time: if one partition goes down then other partition store messages.
  - decide no of partitions at topic creation.
6.offset : a sequence number assign to each message in partition of kafka topic to know the track of consumed messages by Consumer.
7.Consumer group:any consumer can talk to any partition.
8.Zookeeper : track status of kafka cluster nodes,topics,partitions and offsets.
